General complaints about existing work:

	1.Image is of low quality in background, contains too much variation in colour together (read slides 9, colours should be used sparingly). Use more basic images

	2.Font isn't the most interesting

	3.Use more iconography e.g. a little house for a "home" button. There are slides in slides 10 describing how to make icons	

	4.Some buttons on landing page do not animate with hover (sign in, register, shop now buttons in screen centre) - could use raised buttons?

	5.Add logo to page

	6.Logo itself should be link to homepage on every page NOT the homepage

	7.Add dropdown descriptions/captions on each button describing what they do (a la Tesco)

	8.Check cross-platform continuity

	9.Drop down menu on shop page to see different categories

	10.If being v v smart, use predictive text in search bar ?

	11.Should maybe centre page elements - visual acuity is not great that far across a screen
